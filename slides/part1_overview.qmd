## Part 0: Installation

Before we begin, please ensure you have the following installed:

1.  **R:** A recent version of R is required. You can download it from the [Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN)](https://cran.r-project.org/).
2.  **RStudio:** Download the latest version from the [RStudio website](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/). Quarto is built right into RStudio, making it the easiest way to get started. If you have Rstudio already installed, RStudio v2022.07 and later includes support for editing and preview of Quarto documents, and we highly recommend the latest version.

You will also need to install a few R packages. Open RStudio and run the following code in the console:


```{r}
#| eval: false
install.packages(c("palmerpenguins", "tidyverse", "gt", "countdown"))
```


- **palmerpenguins**: For example datasets.
- **tidyverse**: A collection of R packages for data science.
- **gt**: For creating beautiful tables.
- **countdown**: To add timers to your slides.

If you do not already have **rmarkdown** installed, please install that as well:

```{r}
#| eval: false
install.packages("rmarkdown")
```

## What is Quarto?
  
  Quarto is a next-generation version of R Markdown from Posit. It is a powerful tool that allows you to create dynamic documents, presentations, and websites from a single source file.

## Quarto = `.qmd` file = Code + text $\to$ html

`.qmd` files contain code + markdown syntax which can be "rendered" to other formats (html, pdf, Word, etc)

## Why Quarto for Research?

For researchers, reproducibility and clear communication important. Quarto allows us to do both well.

-   **Reproducible Research:** Seamlessly integrate your R code, statistical analyses, and visualizations directly into your reports and presentations.
-   **Professional Outputs:** Create polished articles, presentations for conferences, and websites for your lab or personal portfolio.
-   **Collaboration:** Quarto projects are easy to share and collaborate on using version control systems like Git.
