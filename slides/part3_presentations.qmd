# Getting Started: Your First Presentation

Let's first dive into creating presentations with Quarto. We'll be focusing on `revealjs` for HTML slides, which are very interactive and allow for many types of customizations.

We will talk about how to convert to pdf or use other formats later.

## Create a new Rstudio Project (or Quarto Project)

::: {.panel-tabset}

### Directions

1.  In RStudio, go to `File > New Project... > New Directory > New Project`.

-   You may choose `New Project` OR `Quarto Project`
-   If you choose Quarto Project, a `.qmd` file will already be present in your folder. You would still follow the next steps.
-   A Quarto Project has an extra file to define settings in .qmd files. This is not necessary for our purposes, but it is an option if you will be using lots of .qmd files for various tasks.

2.  Give your project a name (i.e. QuartoPres) and choose a location (i.e. Desktop). Check the box "Open in new session"

### Screenshots

:::


## Create a new Quarto Presentation file

3.  Now go to `File > New File > Quarto Presentation`. Uncheck the box "Use visual markdown editor". Click "create"
4.  This will create a new file with a `.qmd` extension. This is your presentation file!

![](/images/web/quartopres4.png)

## The YAML Header

Every `.qmd` file starts with a YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language) header. This is where you control the main settings for your document.

By default, these basic options are filled in, and you can edit them or add additional options (more later):

``` yaml
---
title: "My Presentation"
author: "Your Name"
format: revealjs
---
```

# Basics

## Revealjs

`revealjs` uses the open source HTML presentation framework [`reveal.js`](https://revealjs.com/){target="_blank"}. Styles are set with CSS and it comes with built in markdown and LaTeX support as well as code syntax highlighting.

More about revealjs can be found on the [Quarto.org docs website](https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs/){target="_blank"} (embedded below):

<iframe width="1000" height="500" src="https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs/" title="Quarto revealjs">

</iframe>

## Creating Slides

You create new slides using markdown headers (`#` or `##`).

``` qmd
# This is a Title Slide

This is the content of my first slide.

## This is a New Slide

Each `##` starts a new slide.
```

-   `##` creates a standard slide with a heading.
-   A slide with only a title and no body text becomes a title/section slide.

# Content Layout

## Scrolling Slides 📜

For slides with a lot of content, you can make them scrollable.

``` qmd
## A Long Slide {.scrollable}

This slide has a lot of content that might not fit on one screen. By adding `{.scrollable}`, you allow the user to scroll down to see the rest of the content.
...
```

You can also include this in the YAML header to make this a global setting so all slides are scrollable.

``` yaml
format: 
  revealjs:
      scrollable: true
```

## A Long Slide {.scrollable}

This slide has a lot of content that might not fit on one screen.

```{r}
library(palmerpenguins)
summary(penguins)
gt(penguins)
```


## Columns


::: {.panel-tabset}
### Columns Code

You can arrange content in columns using Pandoc's fenced `div` blocks.

``` qmd
::: {.columns}
                                        
::: {.column width="50%"}
This is the left column. You can put text, images, or code here.
:::
                                          
::: {.column width="50%"}
This is the right column.
:::
                                          
:::
```

### Columns Example


Here is a 30/70 split:

::::: columns
::: {.column width="30%"}
Here we have the first four rows of the Palmer Penguins Data set.
:::

::: {.column width="70%"}
```{r}
penguins %>% head(4) %>% gt()
```
:::
:::::

:::

# Code and Output

One of Quarto's best features is its ability to seamlessly include code and its output.

## Displaying Code and Output

```` qmd
```{{r}}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
library(palmerpenguins)
summary(penguins)
```
````

-   `#| echo: true` shows the code.
-   `#| eval: true` runs the code and shows the output.

## Code Output Layout

You can control where the output of a code block appears.

-   `#| output-location: beside` places output next to the code.
-   `#| output-location: slide` places output on a new slide following the code slide.
-   `#| output-location: column` places output in a column adjacent to the code.

## Revealing Code Stepwise

You can reveal code and its output incrementally.

-   `#| output-location: fragment` delays showing output until advancing with a click.
-   `#| output-location: column-fragment` places output in a column adjacent to the code and delays showing until advancing with a click.

::::: columns
::: column
```` qmd
```{{r}}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: "fragment"
x <- 3
y <- 2
x + y
x*y
```
````
:::

::: column
Each line will appear on a subsequent click.

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: "fragment"
x <- 3
y <- 2
x + y
x*y
```
:::
:::::

# Exercise 1a: Your First Presentation

-   Create a new Quarto Presentation project.
-   Customize the title slide with your name, a subtitle, and your institution.
    - Hint: there are subtitle, author, institute options in YAML
-   Create 3 new slides, with some R code and output.
-   Create at least one main title slide with no text and observe the behavior of the resulting outline.

# Advanced Code Display

You can control how code is presented.

## Highlighting Code

Use `code-line-numbers` to highlight specific lines.

::::: columns
::: column
```` qmd
```{{r}}
#| code-line-numbers: "3,5-6"
x <- 1
y <- 2
z <- x + y

a <- "hello"
b <- "world"
paste(a, b)
```
````
:::

::: column
```{r}
#| code-line-numbers: "3,5-6"
x <- 1
y <- 2
z <- x + y

a <- "hello"
b <- "world"
paste(a, b)
```
:::
:::::

## Collapsing Code

Use `code-fold: true` to make code blocks expandable.

```` qmd
```{{r}}
#| code-fold: true
#| echo: true
print("This code is hidden by default.")
```
````

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| echo: true
print("This code is hidden by default.")
```

# More Content Layout


## Incremental Lists

Lists can be displayed incrementally:

```qmd
::: incremental
-   First item
-   Second item
-   Third item
:::
```


::: incremental
-   First item
-   Second item
-   Third item
:::


<br/> Insert pauses to make other types of content display incrementally with `<br/>`.

::: footer
Learn more: [Incremental Lists](https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs/#incremental-lists){target="_blank"}
:::

## Incremental Reveals

More customization to show parts of a slide step-by-step can be made with the `.fragment` class. This works on lists, text, images, and more.

``` qmd
::: {.fragment}
Fade in
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-out}
Fade out
:::

::: {.fragment .highlight-red}
Highlight red
:::
```

::: fragment
Fade in
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-out}
Fade out
:::

::: {.fragment .highlight-red}
Highlight red
:::

::: footer
Learn more: [Fragments](https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs/advanced.html#fragments){target="_blank"}
:::


# Exercise 1b: Your First Presentation

-   On one slide, add a bulleted list where each item is revealed incrementally.
-   On another slide, use columns to display text on the left and an image on the right. (Hint: Use `![Caption](image.png)` to add an image).


# Styling Your Presentation

## Themes

You can change the entire look of your presentation with themes.

``` yaml
---
title: "My Presentation"
format:
  revealjs:
    theme: sky
---
```

* Available themes are: `default`, `beige`, `blood`, `dark`, `default`, `dracula`, `league`, `moon`, `night`, `serif`, `simple`, `sky`, `solarized`
* Example of themes are below from <https://revealjs.com/themes/>:

<iframe width="1100" height="500" src="https://revealjs.com/themes/" title="revealjs themes">
</iframe>



## Custom Styles with SCSS

For more control, you can use a `.scss` file to customize your theme.

1.  Create a file named `custom.scss`.
2.  In this file, you can define variables and CSS rules, including changing font color:

``` scss
/*-- scss:defaults --*/
$presentation-heading-font: "Montserrat", sans-serif;
$theme-green: #40ab16;

/*-- scss:rules --*/
.reveal .slide-background-content {
background-color: #F0F0F0;
}
```

3.  Link it in your YAML:

``` yaml
---
format:
  revealjs:
    theme: [default, custom.scss]
---
```


## Customizing the Title Slide

You can add more information to your title slide directly in the YAML header. This is useful for adding affiliations, subtitles, and logos.

``` yaml
---
title: "Workshop Title"
subtitle: "An In-depth Look at Quarto"
author: "Your Name"
institute: "Oregon Health & Science University"
date: "today"
title-slide-attributes:
  data-background-image: "your-logo.png"
  data-background-size: "15%"
  data-background-position: "top right"
format: revealjs
---
```


# Markup & Fine-Tuning

* Adjust font size at different levels: part of a slide, entire slide, or entire document


## Font Size: Part of a slide

::: {.panel-tabset}
### `{.smaller}` and `{.larger}`

Wrap text in square brackets and use a class like `.smaller` or `.larger.`

<br>

```qmd
This is [small text]{.smaller} and this is [large text]{.larger}.
```
This is [small text]{.smaller} and this is [large text]{.larger}.

<br>

[(Note: If this doesn't work, make sure your theme or `.scss` file defines these classes)]{.smaller}

### `font-size` in fenced div

::: {style="font-size: 85%;"}
* Place text within a fenced div specifying the font-size.  
* This option gives more flexibility setting the font size. 
:::

**Example 1:** font size specified in points

```qmd
::: {style="font-size: 14pt;"}
Text is set at 14 pt. 
:::
```

::: {style="font-size: 14pt;"}
Text is set at 14 pt. 
:::


**Example 2:** font size as a percent

```qmd
::: {style="font-size: 75%;"}
Text is at 75% of the default font size. 
:::
```

::: {style="font-size: 75%;"}
Text is at 75% of the default font size. 
:::


:::



## [Auto-fit text size]{.r-fit-text} 

* Use the `{.r-fit-text}` class to **auto-fit text size** to fill the slide.
* **Header**: it makes the header fill one line by either increasing or decreasing the font size. 
    * [Note: I usually have to render the slides twice to get this to work correctly]{.smaller}

```qmd
## [Auto-fit text size]{.r-fit-text} 
```

* **Body text**: The words "Big Text" below were auto-fit to the slide width. 
    * Place text within a fenced div with the class `{.r-fit-text}`.

``` qmd
::: {.r-fit-text}
Big Text
:::
```
::: {.r-fit-text}
Big Text
:::


## Font Size: Entire Slide{.larger}

* Apply `{.smaller}` or `{.larger}` to an entire slide 
    * to make **all** the text on the slide smaller or bigger, 
    * by adding the class to the end of the header. 
* *Note that it also makes the header smaller or larger.*

<br>

* For example, the header above was coded as:

```qmd
## Font Size: Entire Slide{.larger}
```




## Font Size: Entire Document

Use the **font-size** option in your YAML header.

``` yaml
format:
  revealjs:
    font-size: 24px
```



## Customizing Text Styles

For more specific control over fonts for headers or code, you can use a custom `.scss` file.

-   **Slide Headers Font Size:** Change heading sizes in `custom.scss`:

``` scss
$presentation-h1-font-size: 2.5em;
$presentation-h2-font-size: 1.6em;
```

-   **Code vs. Output Font Size:** Adjust code block and output font sizes in `custom.scss`.

``` scss
$code-block-font-size: 0.55em;
```


## Text [color]{style="color:green"}

* The default text color is determined by the theme of the document.

* [You can change]{style="color:red"} [individual bits of text]{style="color:blue"} [by placing square brackets]{style="color:purple"} [around the text to modify]{style="color:#27a710"} [and applying the style class for color to it]{style="color:#CC5500"}. 

The sentence above was coded as:

```qmd
[You can change]{style="color:red"} 
[individual bits of text]{style="color:blue"} 
[by placing square brackets]{style="color:purple"} 
[around the text to modify]{style="color:#27a710"} 
[and applying the style class for color to it]{style="color:#CC5500"}.
```

:::: {style="font-size: 85%;"}
* Note that the 
    * first three colors were specified by **name** (i.e. red, blue, purple), and the
    * last two colors were specified by **hexadecimal** values

::: {.columns}
                                       
::: {.column width="50%"}
* The actual shades of the "named" colors are determined by the theme applied to the slides.     
    * The `scss` file for the theme can be modified to change the colors using hexadecimal values.
* Use a [Hexadecimal color picker](https://htmlcolorcodes.com/color-picker/) to select your favorite colors 
:::
                                          
::: {.column width="50%"}
![](../images/scss_sky_modified_colors.png){fig-align="center" width=70%}
:::
:::

::::


## Slide background {background-color="orange"}

* The background of a slide can be customized as well
    * color
    * image
    * video
    * and more!
* Learn more at Quarto's [Slide Backgrounds](https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs/#slide-backgrounds) reference page.

<br>

* The background of this slide was change by adding `{background-color="orange"}` to the end of the header:

```qmd
## Slide background {background-color="orange"}
```




# More Advanced

There are many, many advanced tools and options shown in the [Quarto presentation, advanced](https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs/advanced.html){target="_blank"} documentation.

# Exercise 2: Code and Customization

-   On a new slide, add an R code chunk that loads the `palmerpenguins` dataset and creates a `gt` table.
-   Make the code chunk collapsible (`code-fold: true`).
-   Highlight the line of code that creates the `gt` table.
-   Change the presentation theme to `solarized.`
-   Create a `custom.scss` file and use it to change the color of the H2 slide titles to a color of your choice.

# Presentation Tools

`revealjs` comes with powerful tools to enhance your presentations.

More about presenter tools can be found on the [Quarto.org docs website](https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs/presenting.html){target="_blank"}

## Fullscreen mode

* Switch to full screen mode when presenting by pressing the `F` key.

<br>

* Press `esc` to exit back to your web browser.


## Speaker Notes

Press `s` to open the speaker view, which shows your notes and a preview of the next slide. Add notes to a slide like this:

``` qmd
## My Slide
    
This is the content everyone sees.
    
::: {.notes}
These are my speaker notes. Only I can see them.
:::
```

To show notes and present in "speaker mode" press `s`.

## Speaker Notes Slide
    
This is the content everyone sees. To show notes and present in "speaker mode" press `s`.
    
::: {.notes}
These are my speaker notes. Only I can see them.
:::


## Annotations & Chalkboard ✍️

Revealjs includes a "chalkboard" that you can use for live drawings and a "notes canvas" for more permanent annotations.

-   Chalkboard: 
    * Press `b` to toggle the chalkboard. You can draw directly on the slide. Press b again to hide it. 
    * Or, click on the chalkboard icon on the bottom left of the slides
-   Notes Canvas: 
    * Press `c` to toggle the notes canvas. This is like drawing on a transparent overlay that stays with the slide.
    * Or, click on the paintbrush icon on the bottom left of the slides

Add the `chalkboard` option in the YAML header to include both the chalkboard and canvas options in your slides, :

``` yaml
---
format: 
  revealjs:
      chalkboard: true
---
```

## Saving & Loading Annotations:

Your drawings are not saved by default. To save them:

-   While in presentation mode, press `d` to download your drawings as a `drawing.json` file.
-   To load these annotations back the next time you present, add the `chalkboard-src:` option to your YAML header:

``` yaml
---
format:
  revealjs:
    chalkboard-src: "drawing.json"
---
```

![](../images/web/quartopres_chalkboard.png)

::: {.footnote}
Learn more at [Quarto's Presenting Slides > Chalkboard](https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs/presenting.html#chalkboard){target="_blank"}
:::


## Outlines

Press `o` to see an outline of your presentation.

![](/images/web/quartopres_outline.png)

## Adding a Countdown Timer ⏳

* A great way to manage time for in-class exercises or breaks is to add a countdown timer directly into your slides. 
* Below we use the countdown package, which we installed earlier.

Let's set a 1-minute timer:

```{r, R-countdown, echo=TRUE}
countdown::countdown(minutes = 1, play_sound = TRUE)
```

This will embed a timer on the slide. You can customize the duration, text, colors, and whether it plays a sound when finished.

# Slide File Formats

Quarto supports a variety of formats for creating presentations, including:

-   `revealjs` — [reveal.js](https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs/){target="_blank"} (HTML)
-   `pptx` — [PowerPoint](https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/powerpoint.html){target="_blank"} (MS Office)
-   `beamer` — [Beamer](https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/beamer.html){target="_blank"} (LaTeX/PDF)

To choose these, merely need to change the yaml `format:` to the type of talk you wish to produce, for example:

``` yaml
---
title: "Mathy Talk"
author: "Jane Doe"
format: beamer
---
```

## HTML Slides

> From [Quarto Docs: Presentations](https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/){target="_blank"}: There are pros and cons to each of these formats. The most capable format by far is revealjs, so it is highly recommended unless you have specific Office or LaTeX output requirements. Note that revealjs presentations can be presented as HTML slides or can be printed to PDF for easier distribution.

# Citations and References

## Setting Up Bibliography

**Step 1:** Add to YAML header

```yaml
---
title: "My Presentation"
format: revealjs
bibliography: references.bib
csl: apa.csl
---
```
(Use csl only if you have a custom csl file, see [Citations](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/citations.html){target="_blank"})

**Step 2:** Create `references.bib`

```bibtex
@article{smith2023,
  title={Important Research},
  author={Smith, John},
  journal={Journal of Science},
  year={2023}
}
```

## Citation Syntax

**In-text citations:**
```markdown
Research shows [@smith2023] that...
Multiple sources [@smith2023; @jones2022]
Page numbers [@smith2023, p. 15]
```

**Citation styles:**
- `[@smith2023]` → (Smith, 2023)
- `@smith2023` → Smith (2023)
- `[-@smith2023]` → (2023)

Here we reference [@smith2023].

## References Slide

**Automatic references:**
```markdown
## References

::: {#refs}
:::
```

**Manual placement:**
```yaml
---
suppress-bibliography: true
---

# Last slide
## References {.smaller}

::: {#refs}
:::
```

## References

::: {#refs}

# Exporting

## Publishing 

We will briefly cover publishing webpages to Quarto Pubs and GitHub in Part 4 of the slides.


## Self Contained (HTML)

HTML documents typically have a number of external dependencies (e.g. images, CSS style sheets, JavaScript, etc.). By default these dependencies are placed in a \_files directory alongside your document. For example, if you render report.qmd to HTML:

Then the following output is produced:

```         
pres.html
pres_files/
```

You might alternatively want to create an entirely self-contained HTML document (with images, CSS style sheets, JavaScript, etc. embedded into the HTML file). You can do this by specifying the embed-resources option:

``` yaml
format:
  revealjs:
    embed-resources: true
```

This will produce a standalone HTML file with no external dependencies, using data: URIs to incorporate the contents of linked scripts, style sheets, images, and videos. The resulting file should be self contained, in the sense that it needs no external files and no net access to be displayed properly by a browser.

:::





# Converting HTML to PDF

## Method 1: Using Chrome/Chromium

```bash
# Install chromium if needed
quarto install chromium

# Render to PDF
quarto render presentation.qmd --to revealjs
# Then use browser print function
# Or use decktape (next slide)
```

## Method 2: Using Decktape

```bash
# Install decktape
npm install -g decktape

# Convert HTML to PDF
decktape reveal presentation.html presentation.pdf

# With custom options
decktape reveal presentation.html presentation.pdf \
  --size 1920x1080 --load-pause 2000
```

## Method 3: Direct PDF Format

```yaml
---
title: "My Presentation"
format:
  revealjs: default
  pdf: default
---
```

```bash
# Render both formats
quarto render presentation.qmd
```

# Converting Qmd Reports to Slides

## From Document to Presentation

**Step 1:** Change the YAML header

```yaml
# From this:
format: html

# To this:
format: revealjs
```

**Step 2:** Adjust heading levels
- `#` becomes section dividers
- `##` becomes slide titles
- `###` becomes slide subtitles

## Content Adaptation Tips

- **Break long paragraphs** into bullet points
- **Split dense content** across multiple slides
- **Add slide breaks** with `---` if needed
- **Use incremental reveals** with `{.incremental}`

```markdown
::: {.incremental}
- First point
- Second point
- Third point
:::
```

## Example Conversion

**Before (Report):**
```markdown
# Analysis Results
Our analysis shows significant findings...

## Data Summary
The dataset contains 1000 observations...
```

**After (Slides):**
```markdown
# Analysis Results

## Key Findings
- Significant results discovered
- Strong correlations identified

## Data Summary
- 1000 observations
- 15 variables analyzed
```
